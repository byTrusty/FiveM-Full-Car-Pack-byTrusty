This '3.0' version of the pack is by no means complete. 
It has a large addition of vehicles, and a lot of fixes for old vehicles.
There are a few vehicles that will spawn with a weird green texture.
I am aware of this and they will get fixed over time. However they do not effect anything, 
you just have to enter a mechanic menu or clean the car and it will fix it.
I know its ugly its only on like 4 or 5 cars, will fix promise.

Whole range of police vehicles added including all of np up to 3.5
All vehicles are under 300k poly count besides the ones listed in the other text.
I would make sure to keep track of how many of those are on the server, it will eventually cause issues.
trust me.
everything else is an amazing car, some of which are obviously leaks, including some vehicle sounds. 
They are just audio files, i know people gotta eat, but it was given to me.

The vehicle config is set up as a np style vehicle tier system, S/S+ cars average 160+ A/A+ 145+ and so on.
if you do not use the vehicle config, please dont ask me why something is not working.
The handling is not perfect on every single car. feel free to take this on and do your own work.
i have a full guide in the handling.meta
there is just so many cars i have not truly driven them all.
but i do my best. if you find cars that are just so wrong you know they should be changed,
please tell me.
enjoy the vehicles. make sure to show love to all the people who made all of these items available.
